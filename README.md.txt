To install and run the Tic Tac Toe Android Application, please follow these steps:

Ensure that you have a compatible Android device or an Android emulator set up on your computer.

Download the APK file of the application from the GitHub repository or any other reliable source.

Transfer the APK file to your Android device if you downloaded it on your computer. You can use methods like USB transfer, email, or cloud storage for this step.

On your Android device, go to Settings > Security or Privacy, depending on your Android version.
